  <h2>What is an SQL Injection?</h2>
  <p>
    SQL Injections are a form of cyber-attack, where a malicious actor can 'inject' an SQL Query into a database via input fields (like login or description fields).
    These allow the malicious actors to read data from the database, execute operations on the database or bypass authentication protocols, such as passwords.
  </p>

  <h2>Consequences of SQL Injections</h2>
  <p>If a program is vulnerable to SQL Injections, this can have a variety of consequences, such as:</p>
  <ul>
    <li><b>Confidentiality:</b> SQL Databases often hold sensitive data, so if a database can be exploited, the confidentiality of the information is at risk.</li>
    <li><b>Authentication:</b> If SQL queries are used to check usernames and passwords, it is possible to construct a query that lets someone log in to an account without knowing the password.</li>
    <li><b>Authorisation:</b> If authorisation information, such as permissions or access controls, are stored in an SQL database, then it may be possible for a malicious actor to edit that information.</li>
    <li><b>Integrity:</b> Similarly, information may be able to be deleted if SQL Injections are a valid attack vector.</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>How to protect against SQL Injections</h2>
  <p>SQL Injections are accomplished by putting meta characters (such as ' or =) into a data input, which causes the SQL Query to fail to operate as intended, and parse
  the input as a part of the query, allowing someone to manipulate the query for personal gain.</p>
  <p>This flaw is dependent on the fact that SQL Queries can't innately differentiate between what's part of the query and what's part of the input. As such, a common method to protect against
  SQL Injection attacks is to utilise 'parametrized statements', where the user input is handled outside the query, and then passed to the query in a 'sanitised' manner.</p>
  <p>Another way to mitigate SQL Injection attacks is by not allowing users to input meta characters into their inputs. This has the downside of not being 100% effective, as well as
  being an inconvenience to the end user. However, alongside other forms of protection, this form of input validation can act as an additional level of security.</p>
  <p>Finally, a design or structural decision that can help mitigate SQL Injection attacks is the 'principle of least privilege', whereby users should only have as many permissions as
  strictly necessary. This is a factor that should largely be implemented in any form of design, as granting users extraneous permissions may allow users to perform unintended actions.</p>


  <h2>Example forms of SQL Injections</h2>
  <p>A common form of SQL Injection is <code>' OR 'a'='a'</code>, which is a category of SQL Injections that cause a clause to always evaluate as true.</p>
  <p>Another common form of SQL Injection is <code>'');</code>, which effectively acts as a 'halt' to the current query and allows the user to then input an additional query, which may
  allow them to manipulate SQL database information.</p>
