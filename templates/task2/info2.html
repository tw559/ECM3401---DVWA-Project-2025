  <h1>Cross-Site Scripting (XSS)</h1>

<div class="content">
  <h2>What is Cross-Site Scripting?</h2>
  <p>
    Cross-Site Scripting or XSS attacks are a form of injection attack in which a malicious actor uses a web application
    to send malicious code, such as a browser side script, which allows them to get the application to run the script,
    which can then be made to run on a different user's session, gain access to cookies or session tokens, or to manipulate
    the contents of an HTML page.
  </p>
  <p>
    Cross-Site Scripting generally comes in two forms: Reflected XSS attacks, and Stored XSS attacks.
  </p>
  <p>
    Reflected XSS attacks occur when the injected script is part of the request sent to the server, most commonly done by
    containing the script in a URL or other link. When the user clicks on the link, the code is sent to the web application, and is
    then 'reflected' back to the user's browser.
  </p>
  <p>
    Stored XSS attacks are when the malicious script is stored on the servers in some way, either in a database, a forum, a blog, etc.
    When the victim calls upon the malicious script, it is then executed and run on the victim's browser.
  </p>

  <h2>Consequences of Cross-Site Scripting Vulnerabilities</h2>
  <p>If a web application is vulnerable to an XSS attack, it can lead to a variety of issues, such as:</p>
  <ul>
    <li><b>Account Compromise:</b> Using XSS attacks, a malicious actor can gain access to a users session cookie, which can allow the actor to
    hijack the users session through a session hijacking attack.</li>
    <li><b>Malware:</b> XSS attacks can be used to install malware, such a Trojan Horse programs, which can severely compromise a users devices.</li>
    <li><b>Information Manipulation:</b> By manipulating the HTML contents, an attacker can edit the information on a page, which can have
    serious consequences, such as impacting a companies stock prices or modifying a pharmaceutical sites dosage information. </li>
  </ul>

  <h2>How to protect against XSS</h2>
  <p>As with many forms of injection attacks, a layered approach to protection is advised.</p>
  <p>One of the main methods to protect against XSS attacks is 'escaping' the user input, replacing characters such as <, & and " with their
  'safer' counterparts, which prevents the inputs from being treated as HTML or JavaScript code.</p>
  <p>Another method that should be implemented is Input Validation and Sanitization. Input Validation is the method of making sure that inputs
    conform to the expected formats, such as usernames and email addresses. The recommended form of this is called 'Allowlisting',
    which is defining what forms the input are allowed to take, and denying anything that fails to conform to that mould. The alternative
    is 'Denylisting', which is significantly weaker, as malicious actors can find ways to circumvent the 'banned' parameters, as well as often
    causing false positives.</p>
  <p>Finally, making sure to mark cookies as HttpOnly can help 'hide' them from JavaScript, which can help protect them from XSS attacks.</p>


  <h2>Example forms of XSS Attack</h2>
  <p>The most basic version of an XSS injection is <code>'&lt;script&gt;alert('XSS');&lt;/script&gt;'</code>. If a web application reflects this input and executes
  the script, then the browser will pop up an alert which says 'XSS'. This demonstrates that the input field is vulnerable to an XSS injection,
  and the attacker could then replace the alert() script with more harmful code, or grab cookies.</p>
  <p>Link based attacks are the other primary way of performing an XSS attack, where an url such as <code>https://example.com/
    search?q=&lt;script&gt;alert('XSS')&lt;/script&gt;</code> will cause the HTMl script of a page to load q as the script, which will then cause
  an alert to pop up. Similarly to the injection shown above, the alert() script can be replaced with more harmful code.</p>
  <p>Going in to detail on the more malicious code scripts that can be utilised is beyond the scope of this application, but basically any
  JavaScript code can be utilised, and applications with poor security implementation that store passwords and such in plain sight can be
  vulnerable to simple calls like <code>'&lt;script&gt;alert(document.cookies);&lt;/script&gt;'</code></p>
