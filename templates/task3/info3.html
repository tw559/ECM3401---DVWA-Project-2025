    <h1>Weak Passwords</h1>
</header>

<div class="content">
    <h2>What is a Weak Password?</h2>
    <p>
        Weak Passwords are a common security vulnerability present in many applications and services. They are commonly caused by either
        poor security knowledge on behalf of the user, or poor implementation/design of security protocols in an organisation. They exist
        when a password to an application or account easily guessed, either because it contains personal identifying information, or is
        easily guessed.
    </p>
    <p>
        Attacks that rely on weak passwords are often either Brute Force Attacks or Social Engineering Attacks.
    </p>
    <p>
        A Brute Force Attack is one that simply just iterates through every possible password. While extremely computationally expensive and often
        not particularly viable for breaking passwords with any degree of complexity, with even 'Password123'  taking a while for basic brute
        force algorithm to crack, more advanced strategies have been developed, such as 'Dictionary Attacks', which only test passwords in accordance
        with whatever dataset the algorithm uses. Traditionally, this was a dictionary, hence the name, but modern datasets utilise repositories of
        previously obtained passwords from data breaches.
    </p>
    <p>
        Unlike Brute Force Attacks, which engage solely with the application, Social Engineering Attacks instead either convince them to hand over
        the password, or to guess their password based around information gained about the user such as their birthday, pets or family.
    </p>

    <h2>Consequences of Cross-Site Scripting Vulnerabilities</h2>
    <p>If a web application is vulnerable to an XSS attack, it can lead to a variety of issues, such as:</p>
    <ul>
        <li><b>Account Compromise:</b> If a malicious actor can guess a user's password, then that account is compromised which can allow the
        attacker to gain access to sensitive documents and information.</li>
        <li><b>Identity Theft:</b> Once an attacker has access to a users account, they can use that to impersonate the user and send messages, withdraw
        money from banking applications or many other options. </li>
        <li><b>Password Reuse:</b> When a password has been 'cracked', it's often added to a database of known passwords, which can further impact
        the user if they have reused their passwords across any applications. </li>
    </ul>

    <h2>How to make sure your Passwords are more secure</h2>
    <p>No password is ever truly secure, as hypothetically an attacker could get extremely lucky and guess the password the first time.</p>
    <p>However, making sure that your password is sufficiently complex can do a lot to increase the security of your password. OWASP recommends a
    minimum password length of 12 characters, and having the password contain a variety of types of characters (uppercase, lower case, symbols).</p>
    <p>Users should also be educated on good security practices, such as not sharing passwords, making sure to change your passwords regularly and not
    reusing passwords.</p>
    <p>Finally, making use of Mutlifactor Authentication can help to further increase the security, as attackers will need to bypass multiple
    forms of authentication.</p>


    <h2>Example forms of XSS Attack</h2>
    <p>Social Engineering attacks will often be performed by someone claiming to be a person in a position of authority. An example is given below:</p>
    <blockquote>“Hi, this is Alex from IT. We’re investigating a potential security breach and need to verify your identity to reset your email password.
        Can you please confirm your current password so we can proceed?”</blockquote>
    <p>As seen, 'Alex' is claiming to be someone from a position of authority so they gain your trust, and presenting an urgent issue that will cause
    the user to panic and hopefully ignore any security protocols in place.</p>
    <p>Brute Force Algorithms instead work by iterating through either a dataset (such as with Dictionary Attacks) or just through every possible option.</p>
