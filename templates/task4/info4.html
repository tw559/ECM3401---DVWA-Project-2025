  <h2>What is Broken Authorization?</h2>
  <p>Broken Authorization (also called Privilege Escalation) is when a system has insufficient authorization checks to
  check whether a user should have access to a page or system.</p>
  <p>In a secure system, users are permitted or denied access to certain sections or functions of the system based
  on whatever privileges the user has been assigned. However, the designation system can get fairly complicated,
  and result in inconsistent systems or improper privilege assignment, which can allow a malicious actor to gain more
  access to a system than they should otherwise have.</p>
  <p>There are two main forms of authorization control bypasses; horizontal and vertical control.</p>
  <p>Horizontal Control Bypass is when an attacker gains access to another users account that contains equal privilege,
  whereas Vertical Control Bypass is when an attacker gains access to an increased level of access, such as to
  an admin account or page.</p>

  <h2>Consequences of Broken Authorization</h2>
  <p>If a system has a Broken Authorization Vulnerability, then the following issues could occur:</p>
  <ul>
    <li><b>Account Compromise:</b> Horizontal Control Bypass can allow an attacker to gain access to another user's account,
    allowing them to perform actions on behalf of the user such as withdrawing money, sending messages or even
    deleting the account.</li>
    <li><b>Critical System Access:</b> Vertical Control Bypass allows an attacker to gain increased privileges, which
    if they can continue to do so, can allow them to gain access to critical systems or even obtain full system control,
    which can be devastating for the functioning and security of a system.</li>
  </ul>


  <h2>How to protect against Broken Authorization</h2>
  <p>An access control matrix, which defines what users should have what privileges, alongside the use of role-based
  access control are a basic step that developers can take in order to make sure that users only have the minimum
  required permissions, as granting users superfluous privileges can be detrimental to the security of a system.</p>
  <p>Additionally, making sure that access control is checked on every page of a web application makes sure that
  users cannot access a page or a function simply by requesting direct access to that page.</p>


  <h2>Example forms of Broken Authorization</h2>
  <p>An example of Horizontal Control bypass is by typing in a user ID to an account page to directly access that user's
  page, without having to log in.</p>
  <blockquote>
    <code>http://vulnerablesite.com/user/19000000</code> <br>
    <code>http://vulnerablesite.com/user/19000001</code> <br>
    <code>etc.</code>
  </blockquote>
  <p>An example of Vertical Control bypass would be if the admin page of a web application didn't require a user
  to be logged in as an admin to visit it, allowing an attacker to effectively 'guess' what the URL of the admin
  page and gain direct admin access.</p>
